## Description

This drag and drop task board can help you organize your to-do list. The goal of this project for me was to solidify my JavaScript skills as well as get me familiar with third-party APIs. In this project, I attempted to use DayJS for knowing when my tasks are due. However, I ran into a lot of issues and was ultimately not able to figure it out. I hope to come back to this project in the future, but for now, I am choosing to move on.

## Usage

Add a task by clicking the "Add Task" button and enter a title, due date, and description. Drag and drop the task into the "in progress" lane when you start working on it and the "done" lane when you have finished. Delete your task when you are done with the delete button.
